## Unity Scripts Library

[![API](https://img.shields.io/badge/api-docs-informational.svg)](https://glitchedpolygons.github.io/UnityScriptsLibraryDocs/api/index.html)

Welcome to the official Glitched Polygons scripts library for your free and open-source usage within your next Unity project :)  

Enjoy!

---

These are reusable, modular C# scripts thought as quality-of-life improvements when programming Unity projects.

There is means of [unique identification within scenes](https://glitchedpolygons.github.io/UnityScriptsLibraryDocs/api/GlitchedPolygons.Identification.html), 
an entire [savegame framework](https://glitchedpolygons.github.io/UnityScriptsLibraryDocs/api/GlitchedPolygons.SavegameFramework.html), [trigger volumes with custom inspector and pleasant integration of UnityEvents](https://glitchedpolygons.github.io/UnityScriptsLibraryDocs/api/GlitchedPolygons.TriggerVolumes.TriggerVolume.html)  
as well as a generic [input management system](https://glitchedpolygons.github.io/UnityScriptsLibraryDocs/api/GlitchedPolygons.Input.html) based on the old Unity InputManager, and many other nifty little things and [extension methods](https://glitchedpolygons.github.io/UnityScriptsLibraryDocs/api/GlitchedPolygons.ExtensionMethods.html).

Most of these I developed and improved over the years, that's why some of the files can date down back to even 2014 in certain cases.

Nonetheless, most of them are still very much relevant today and I still use these repeatedly in my own personal Unity projects. Feel free to (ab)use of this as much as desired, it's [MIT-licensed](https://github.com/GlitchedPolygons/UnityScriptsLibrary/blob/master/LICENSE.md) :)
